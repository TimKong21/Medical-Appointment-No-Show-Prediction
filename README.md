# Predicting Patient No-Shows in Healthcare Appointments


## Business Problem
A significant issue in medical setting is patients failing to attend scheduled doctor appointments despite receiving instructions (no-shows). Our client, a medical ERP solutions provider, seeks to tackle this by introducing a machine learning model into their software. This model aims to predict patient attendance, enabling medical providers to optimize appointment management.

## Dataset Description
The dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) utilized in this project comprises appointment records from medical institutions, capturing various attributes related to patients and their appointments. Key features include:
- **Patient demographics**: age and gender
- **Health characteristics**: the presence of conditions such as diabetes or hypertension
- **Appointment-specific details**: scheduled and appointment dates, and whether the patient received a reminder SMS
- **Target**: binary indicator representing whether a patient was a no-show or attended their appointment.

    | No | Column Name | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 01 | PatientId | Identification of a patient |
    | 02 | AppointmentID | Identification of each appointment |
    | 03 | Gender | Male or Female. Female is the greater proportion, women take way more care of their health in comparison to men. |
    | 04 | ScheduledDay | The day someone called or registered the appointment, this is before the appointment of course. |
    | 05 | AppointmentDay | The day of the actual appointment, when they have to visit the doctor. |
    | 06 | Age | How old is the patient. |
    | 07 | Neighbourhood | Where the appointment takes place. |
    | 08 | Scholarship | True or False. Indicates whether the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Fam√≠lia. |
    | 09 | Hipertension | True or False. Indicates if the patient has hypertension. |
    | 10 | Diabetes | True or False. Indicates if the patient has diabetes. |
    | 11 | Alcoholism | True or False. Indicates if the patient is an alcoholic. |
    | 12 | Handcap | True or False. Indicates if the patient is handicapped. |
    | 13 | SMS_received | True or False. Indicates if 1 or more messages sent to the patient. |
    | 14 | No-show | True or False (Target variable). Indicates if the patient missed their appointment. |

This rich dataset provides a comprehensive view of factors potentially influencing patient attendance, enabling the development of a nuanced predictive model.


## Solution approach
- **Model Development:** Created a machine learning model to assess the likelihood of patient no-shows, enhancing appointment scheduling efficiency.
- **System Integration:** Deployed the model with an API for integration into the client's ERP system, this allows real-time predictions, streamlining the ERP's existing workflow.
